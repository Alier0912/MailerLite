# Subscriber Database Analysis

## Findings
1. **Subscriber Growth Trends**: The analysis of the `subscribers_growth` table indicates a monthly growth pattern in subscriber numbers. The data shows fluctuations in growth rates, which may correlate with marketing campaigns or seasonal trends.

2. **Retention Rates**: The retention rate over 90 days is calculated, revealing that a significant percentage of subscribers do not engage after their initial sign-up. This suggests a need for improved onboarding processes or follow-up strategies.

3. **Engagement Insights**: The engagement analysis highlights that certain sources bring in a high volume of subscribers but result in low engagement rates. This indicates that while these sources are effective for acquisition, they may not be ideal for long-term retention.

4. **At-Risk Subscribers**: A considerable portion of the subscriber base is classified as “at risk,” defined by low engagement scores and inactivity over the last 60-90 days. This group requires immediate attention to prevent churn.

## Conclusions
- The current subscriber acquisition strategies are effective in generating leads but lack in maintaining engagement. 
- There is a clear need for targeted re-engagement campaigns aimed at at-risk subscribers to improve retention rates.
- The data suggests that not all acquisition sources are equal; some may need to be reevaluated or optimized to enhance overall engagement.

## Recommendations
1. **Enhance Onboarding**: Implement a more robust onboarding process that includes personalized communication and value propositions to improve initial engagement.
2. **Targeted Re-Engagement Campaigns**: Develop campaigns specifically aimed at at-risk subscribers, offering incentives or tailored content to encourage re-engagement.
3. **Source Evaluation**: Regularly assess the performance of different acquisition sources to identify which are yielding high engagement and which are not, adjusting strategies accordingly.
4. **Monitor Engagement Metrics**: Continuously track engagement metrics to identify trends and make data-driven decisions for future marketing strategies.
